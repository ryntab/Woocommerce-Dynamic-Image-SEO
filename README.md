## Description
<strong>"alt seo"</strong> dynamically adds relevant 'alt' and 'title' attributes to your woocommerce images based on selected meta constructors. By default woocommerce leaves alt and title tags blank, using this plugin you can add relevant data to all your Woo images instantly. It's a fast and simple boost to your on page seo.

Currently I am working on including more post meta feilds from other popular SEO plugins. Unfortunately plugins that do not support meta editing for woocommerce products will not be included ex: All In One Seo Pack

## Putting it all together
You can select four different fields which will be constructed from L -> R. Optionally, you can concatenate in SEO friendly characters to add some structure to your alt and title attributes.

In this example the alt is set to the product title (hyphen) yoast keyword site title.
```
Outputs -> <img alt="Zinnus Bed Frame - Solid Dark Oak Bedframe on Amazon.com"src="#anexampleimage">
```
